# 6LetterWordExercise

## 6 letter words

There's a file in the Assets folder of the repository, input.txt, that contains words of varying lengths (1 to 6 characters).

The objective is to show all combinations of those words that:

   - Together form a word of 6 characters.
   - That combination must also be present in input.txt.

Example

When the program is run with this input:

```
foobar
fo
o
bar
```

Then the program should output:

```
fo+o+bar=foobar
```
